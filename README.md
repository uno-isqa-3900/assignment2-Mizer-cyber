# Assignment 2 - Building an Integrated Multi-Table Web Application

## Objectives
1. Demonstrate basic HTML, Python skills in building a web application integrated with both a database and an external web services using an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
2. Demonstrate your ability to work with cloud based systems and on premise applications and services.
3. Gain an understanding of the value of the MVT (Model View Template) Framework.
4. Develop a MULTI-TABLE web/database application.
5. Demonstrate best practice code management by using Git on your laptop and GitHub as a code repository.  
6. Demonstrate ability to build and execute functional test cases for an application.

**Note: See the ‘Assign 2 - Tutorial - Maverick Food Services Tutorial’ file posted to Canvas for additional details.

## Introduction
I use the Maverick  Food Services as a name for a fictitious organization which provides food services in a campus setting. Imagine if you were a catering manager for the food services organization and needed to keep track of their customers and want to grow their profits by marketing to these customers and their colleagues. To do that you need some type of a database to track your customers and the products and services they acquire from you over time.  This is sometime called a customer information database or a customer relationship management database or CRM for short. We will be building a CRM for the Maverick Food services Organization. I am providing an application shell which starts the application but you must complete it both on your local machine and deploy the application to the Heroku cloud hosting facility or to PythonAnywhere.

## Deliverables for Assign 2:
1. Prepare a Word document with a few screenshots of your unit test environment running on your laptop with screenshots of the Maverick Food Service CRM Application  and the admin section of the application. The URL should be easily visible in the screenshots showing localhost `127.0.0.1`.
2. Add to the Word document a link to your MFS CRM application running on Heroku or PythonAnywhere. 
3. Also add the Maverick Food Service code to Github and provide me read access. A simple link is enough unless you made the repository private. Add the link to the word document. 
4. Create an additional superuser (for the instructor teaching this class) in the application deployed to Heroku or PythonAnywhere with the following credentials so I can login and use all features of the application:
```script
ID: instructor
Email: groyce@unomaha.edu
Password: instructor1a

ID: instructor
Email: spawaskar@unomaha.edu
Password: instructor1a

ID: instructor
Email: svlasnik@unomaha.edu
Password: instructor1a
```
5. Create a Functional Test Cases Spreadsheet for this application based on the sample file provided with this assignment and include this file in your GitHub repo. See this Assignment on Canvas for a sample file that includes a template.
